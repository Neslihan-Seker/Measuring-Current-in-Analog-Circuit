Measuring Current in Analog Circuit in Proteus
# Current Measurement in Analog Circuit - Proteus Project

## Overview

This project is an analog circuit simulation created in Proteus (version 8.14). The goal is to measure the current inside the circuit, providing a virtual environment to understand and test current measurement techniques.


## Features

- Simulates an analog circuit for current measurement.

## Getting Started
